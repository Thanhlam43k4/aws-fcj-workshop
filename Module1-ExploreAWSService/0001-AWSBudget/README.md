# Cost Management With AWS Budget

## Overview

In this lab, we will explore how AWS Budgets can assist you in cost management within your AWS account.

## AWS Budgets

AWS Budgets is a service designed to enable you to establish one-time or recurring budgets. These budgets will send you alerts whenever costs exceed your predetermined budgeted cost or usage amount.

You can create several types of budgets:

- Cost Budget
- Usage Budget
- Reserved Instance (RI) Budget
- Savings Plans Budget

## Cost Budget

A Cost Budget provides alerts when the current or projected spending surpasses the cost threshold set within the budget.

## Usage Budget

A Usage Budget sends alerts when the current or projected usage of a chosen service or group of services exceeds the usage budget threshold. For instance, you could budget the usage of running hours for EC2 compute services.

## Reserved Instance (RI) Budget

The RI Budget generates alerts based on your usage or coverage of committed usage, also known as a reserved instance.

> **Note**: A Reserved Instance is a discounted EC2 offering when you commit to a one-year or three-year term.

## Savings Plans Budget

With the Savings Plans Budget, you will receive alerts based on usage or coverage of services specified within savings plans.
