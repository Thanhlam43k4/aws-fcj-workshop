## Get Started With AWS Cloud9

### Overview

AWS Cloud9 is an integrated development environment (IDE) that works directly in your web browser. 

The AWS Cloud9 IDE provides a rich code editing experience with support for several programming languages, runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal interface. Cloud9 comes with the tools you need to code, build, run, test, and debug your software, helping you release it to the cloud.

Cloud9 will be used frequently in Cloud Journey Labs, so in this lab, we will learn the most basic operations when working with Cloud9.
