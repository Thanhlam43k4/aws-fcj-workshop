# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Lab Overview

## Overview

In this lab, you will enhance the access management of your AWS account using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. The lab will guide you through creating an IAM Group, assigning Admin rights via an IAM Policy, and adding an IAM User to that group, thereby granting the user Admin rights.

## AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Overview

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a powerful web service that enables you to effectively manage access to your AWS resources while maintaining security. IAM provides centralized control over permissions, allowing you to determine which users have access to specific AWS resources.

### Key Features and Components of IAM:

- **Centralized Control:** IAM allows you to define who can access what resources in your AWS account, ensuring secure management of resources.
- **Granular Permissions:** You can assign fine-grained permissions to IAM Users, Groups, and Roles, allowing specific actions on specific resources.
- **Security Best Practices:** By using IAM, you can follow security best practices, such as using the least privilege principle and avoiding the use of root user credentials for everyday tasks.

## AWS Account Root User

When you create an AWS account, you are provided with an initial sign-in identity known as the **AWS Account Root User**. This root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources within the account.

### Important Considerations:

- **Full Access:** The root user possesses unrestricted access to everything in your AWS account.
- **Security Best Practices:** Itâ€™s crucial to protect the root user credentials and avoid using the root user for everyday tasks. The root user should be reserved for tasks that require its unique level of access.
- **Guidance:** For tasks that specifically require root user credentials, refer to the [AWS Account Management Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html).

By following this lab, you'll gain practical experience in managing access to AWS resources using IAM, helping you to implement security best practices in your AWS environment.
