# Types of Support Requests

In the AWS Management Console, you have the ability to initiate three different types of support requests with AWS Support:

## 1. Account and Billing Support

This type of support is available to all AWS users. It allows you to seek assistance regarding account-related and billing-related inquiries.

## 2. Service Limit Increase

AWS provides support for requests to increase service limits, which is applicable to all users. For detailed information about default limits, refer to the [AWS services limits documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

## 3. Technical Support

This category involves seeking assistance from Technical Support for issues specifically related to third-party services or applications. The availability and method of communication depend on your subscription package:

- **Developer Package:** You can communicate your concerns either via email or through the Support Center website.
- **Business or Enterprise Plan:** You have the option to communicate either over the phone or by sending messages online.

**Note:** Users with the Basic support package will not have the ability to create technical support requests.
