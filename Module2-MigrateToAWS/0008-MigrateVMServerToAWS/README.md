# Virtual Machine (VM) Import/Export


## Overview

In this lab, you will practise VM Import/Export, an exercise that builds on the knowledge from previous labs. To do this lab, you need to have AWS CLI and virtualization environment (Virtual Box) installed on your computer.

## VM Import/Export

VM Import/Export is a service that allows you to import Virtual machines (VMs) from your virtualized environment to Amazon EC2 and vice versa. This feature allows you to migrate applications and infrastrucutre resources from an on-prem virtualized environment to Amazon EC2, back up your virtual machines to EC2, and create an archive of virtual machines for redundancy and recovery after a crash.

You can use VM Import/Export with no service Charges (Except for EC2, VMs and `S3 Bucket`)


## AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

`AWS S3` is a large data storage service, with an `S3 Bucket` containing many `Objects`. You can store an object up to 5TB in size, and there is no limit to the number of objects stored in a bucket.
